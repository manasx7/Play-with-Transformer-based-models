# ðŸŽˆ Play-with-Transformer-based-Models

This is a web-based application built with **Streamlit** that allows users to interact with various transformer-based models for a wide range of machine learning tasks. The app integrates Hugging Face's **Transformers** library and other popular Python tools, enabling real-time processing of text and images. 

Users can leverage pre-trained models or upload their own custom models for tasks like **text generation**, **sentiment analysis**, **summarization**, **zero-shot classification**, and **image classification**. The app also includes interactive features and data visualizations to make model outputs more intuitive and engaging.

### **Key Features**
- **Pre-trained Models**: Access a wide range of models for tasks such as summarization, sentiment analysis, and more.
- **Custom Model Support**: Upload and use your own PyTorch model files (`.bin`, `.pt`, `.zip`) for any supported task.
- **Real-time Processing**: Perform tasks like text summarization, sentiment analysis, and image classification instantly.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easily select tasks, models, and input data through a simple, user-friendly web interface.
- **Data Visualizations**: Visual outputs such as word clouds, probability distributions, and heatmaps to enhance understanding of model predictions.

### **Available Tasks**
1. **Summarization**: Input long text and generate a concise summary using powerful models.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze and detect the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the input text.
3. **Zero-Shot Classification**: Classify text into predefined categories without additional model training.
4. **Text Generation**: Generate text based on an initial prompt using methods like sampling or beam search.
5. **Image Classification**: Upload images for classification using pre-trained models or custom labels.

### **Custom Model Support**
- Upload your own custom models for any of the tasks. The app automatically loads and uses the models for inference without additional setup.

### **Data Visualizations**
- **Word Clouds**: For sentiment analysis tasks, visualize the most frequent words in the text.
- **Probability Distributions**: For text generation tasks, view the probability distribution of the next predicted word in a bar chart.
- **Heatmaps**: For image classification tasks, visualize the model's attention on different parts of the image.

### **Getting Started**
Simply select your desired task, choose from a variety of pre-trained models or upload your custom model, and interact with the outputs in real time. With its interactive features and intuitive interface, this app is perfect for both beginners and advanced users exploring the power of transformer-based models.
