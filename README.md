# ðŸŽˆ Play-with-Transformer-based-Models

**[Try the app ðŸ‘€](https://transformer-based-models-playground.streamlit.app/)**

This is a web-based application built with **Streamlit** that allows users to interact with various transformer-based models for a wide range of machine learning tasks. The app integrates Hugging Face's **Transformers** library and other popular Python tools, enabling real-time processing of text and images. 

Users can leverage pre-trained models or upload their own custom models for tasks like **text generation**, **sentiment analysis**, **summarization**, **zero-shot classification**, and **image classification**. The app also includes interactive features and data visualizations to make model outputs more intuitive and engaging.

### **Key Features**
- **Pre-trained Models**: Access a wide range of models for tasks such as summarization, sentiment analysis, and more.
- **Custom Model Support**: Upload and use your own PyTorch model files (`.bin`, `.pt`, `.zip`) for any supported task.
- **Real-time Processing**: Perform tasks like text summarization, sentiment analysis, and image classification instantly.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easily select tasks, models, and input data through a simple, user-friendly web interface.
- **Data Visualizations**: Visual outputs such as word clouds, probability distributions, and heatmaps to enhance understanding of model predictions.

### **Available Tasks**
1. **Summarization**: Input long text and generate a concise summary using powerful models.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze and detect the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the input text.
3. **Zero-Shot Classification**: Classify text into predefined categories without additional model training.
4. **Text Generation**: Generate text based on an initial prompt using methods like sampling or beam search.
5. **Image Classification**: Upload images for classification using pre-trained models or custom labels.

### **Custom Model Support**
- Upload your own custom models for any of the tasks. The app automatically loads and uses the models for inference without additional setup.

### **Data Visualizations**
- **Word Clouds**: For sentiment analysis tasks, visualize the most frequent words in the text.
- **Probability Distributions**: For text generation tasks, view the probability distribution of the next predicted word in a bar chart.
- **Heatmaps**: For image classification tasks, visualize the model's attention on different parts of the image.

# ðŸ“Œ How It Works

1. **Select a Task**: Choose from tasks like summarization, sentiment analysis, zero-shot classification, text generation, or image classification.
2. **Model Selection**: Pick from a list of pre-trained models or upload your custom model.
3. **Input Data**: Provide the necessary input for the selected task (e.g., text for sentiment analysis or summarization, image for classification).
4. **Get Results**: The model processes the input and returns results, including text, classifications, or visual outputs (e.g., word clouds, bar charts).
5. **Visual Outputs**: Depending on the task, graphical outputs like word clouds, heatmaps, or probability distributions are generated and displayed.

### **Example Usage**

- **Summarization**:
  - **Task**: Summarize a given piece of text.
  - **Input**: Paste a large block of text.
  - **Output**: A concise summary of the text.
