#ðŸ“Œ How It Works:-
  -> Select a Task: Choose from summarization, sentiment analysis, zero-shot classification, text generation, or image classification.
  -> Model Selection: Choose from a list of pre-trained models or upload a custom model.
  -> Input Data: Provide the necessary input for the task (e.g., text for sentiment analysis or summarization, image for classification).
  -> Get Results: The model processes the input and displays results such as text, classifications, or visualizations (e.g., word clouds, bar charts).
  -> Visual Outputs: Depending on the task, the app generates and displays additional graphical outputs like word clouds or heatmaps.

Example Usage
    Summarization
        Task: Summarize a given piece of text.
        Input: Paste a large block of text.
        Output: A concise summary of the text.
    Sentiment Analysis
        Task: Analyze the sentiment of a text.
        Input: Paste a review or social media post.
        Output: Sentiment result (positive/negative) along with a confidence score and word cloud of frequently occurring terms.
    Zero-Shot Classification
        Task: Classify text into predefined categories.
        Input: Paste text and provide candidate labels (e.g., 'Technology', 'Health').
        Output: Classification result with the most likely category and its confidence score.
    Text Generation
        Task: Generate text based on an input prompt.
        Input: Provide an initial prompt.
        Output: Continuation of the prompt with generated text and a chart showing the probability distribution of the next word.
    Image Classification
        Task: Classify an image.
        Input: Upload an image.
        Output: Classification results with confidence scores and optional custom labels.
